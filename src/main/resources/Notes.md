In monolithic applications, we need to handle the persistent logics in common way. that means we cannot save 
them service by service. so ex: user service, driver service, everything we need to persist through a common
entity. so that is why we always need to use entity and extend it by another things.


Questions:
1. Do we need entity layer in microservices?
2. In normally we are using the common persist way to do?
3. Who can contact for this?
